### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The code we were giveen was the building blocks of an AI code that allows the program to learn how to solve a simple maze puzzle. The code I added was the code that actually allowed the AI to make moves and store/recall previous moves. Thiss allowed the AI to remember which move were more successful to help it get a better score quicker. 

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
Computer scientists work in the field of computers. There job is to make functioning systems that help improve the live of others. Like simplifying work tasks, or making storage and access of data simplar and more secure.
As computer scientists we approach problems by breaking down there components into simple easy to understand steps. By doing this, it allows us to figure out the best way to code any given probelem by writing those simple conspets into code that can be ran in a computer.
The ethical responsibilities of a computer scientist are that we must make code that works, and that is secure enough to not put any of our users/organizations at risk.
